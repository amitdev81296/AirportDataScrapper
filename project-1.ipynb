This is the first portion of a two-part, open-ended team assignment that will culminate in a presentation during the last week of class or the regularly scheduled final exam period. Overall, this term project is intended to provide some open-ended experience with building a complex dataset and making it available. Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following:\n",

    "- The construction, acquistion, integration, enrichment, and distribution of a project-motivated and computationally significant dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first report on your team's project will constitue a discussion of what the dataset is that you want to build/access/create, why you believe it will be possilbe to conduct, and how long you believe it will take to build, in addition to discussion of the sorts of tasks that will be involved. Additionally, this inital project planning report should speculate and provide examples potential dataset uses, whether academic or commercial.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: All reports should inclue a high level abstract/discussion in a tone that is set for a completely diverse audience.\n",

    "__Important__: because your project reports will have discussion intermingled with data and code as output, I not only request the  submission of your work in Jupyter Notebooks format, but additionly recommend conducting your work as a group collaboratively in Jupyter notebooks."

    "The Skeptical movement is focused on advocating for science education and critical thinking in all aspects of life. Often mystical/supernatural explanations are given for phenomena that are wholly explainable by ordinary events. One such subject making a resurgence in the current events is UFOs. Obviously their name states that we explicitly don't know what the object is, however people are quick to jump to aliens visiting earth or other equally absurd notions. Skeptic groups are often critical of such claims and despite the claimant's lack of supporting evidence they often lay the burden of proof at the skeptic's feet. While we can never prove a negative and we won't be able to counter every reported sighting, we might be able to plausibly explain many reports if we can show the correlation between sighting location and air traffic. \n",

The US government admitted to actively encouraging UFO conspiracies during the 60s-70s since the assertions raised by these groups are usually discounted and so any photographs of military aircraft wouldn't be as likely to be picked up by the Soviets. So in addition to providing a useful metric to debunk UFO theories, it may also be leveraged to identify new secret aircraft built by either the US or another nation."
